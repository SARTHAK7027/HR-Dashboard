# HR-Analytical Dashboard 

Developed an insightful powerbi dashboard that would help all the HR's accross the globe to analyze the rate of retition(based on several factors) within their respective organizations. By incorporating multiple metrics and parameters such as employee demographics, departmental data, tenure, performance reviews, and even sentiment analysis from surveys or feedback, this dashboard can offer a comprehensive view of retention trends.
Not only does it provide a high-level overview of the overall retention rate, but it also allows for deep dives into specific areas or segments where retention might be a concern. For instance, it could pinpoint if certain departments, locations, or age groups are experiencing higher turnover rates.

Moreover, the dashboard's interactivity can be a game-changer. HR personnel can manipulate filters or select different variables to instantly see how changes in factors like benefits, training programs, or managerial styles affect retention rates.

Visualizations like trend graphs, heatmaps, or comparative charts can help in identifying patterns or correlations. If, for instance, a decline in retention coincides with a change in management or a specific policy implementation, this dashboard could highlight these correlations, aiding in making data-driven decisions to address the issue.
Sharing this dashboard with HR professionals globally could foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing. It could serve as a benchmarking tool, allowing different organizations to compare their retention rates and strategies, leading to a collective effort to improve employee retention globally.
